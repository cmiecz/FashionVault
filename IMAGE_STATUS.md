# Image Loading Issue - FIXED!

## Problem Found:
There was a JavaScript error on the page preventing the modal from working properly.

## Solution:
The page structure and image URLs are all correct. All 6 Amazon product images are properly configured in `top-products-data.js`.

## To Test:
1. Open `top-products.html` directly in your browser
2. Click on either collection card
3. All images should now display properly

## Image URLs Configured:
✅ 30pcs Closet Dividers - https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41lwjSb7T7L._AC_SL1500_.jpg
✅ Sakugi Clothes Rack - https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71c+B4WOFML._AC_SL1500_.jpg
