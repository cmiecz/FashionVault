### Step 3: AI Does the Work
Once you've selected your photo, our AI will automatically:
- Identify what type of item it is
- Extract details like brand, size, and category
- Detect colors and materials
- Remove the background and create a professional product image

This happens in seconds and saves you tons of time!

## Pro Tips for Best Results

### Photography Tips
- Use natural lighting when possible
- Lay items flat or hang them up
- Make sure the entire item is visible in the frame
- Avoid cluttered backgrounds (AI removes them, but clearer photos = better results)

### Getting More Details
- **Scan Labels**: Take close-up photos of care labels to capture exact fabric content, size, and brand information
- **Multiple Photos**: Add photos from different angles to capture all details
- **Scan Details Button**: After adding an item, use this to scan additional photos like serial numbers or model tags (great for equipment!)

### Organization Tips
- Add storage locations so you can find items easily
- Use occasion and season tags to get better outfit recommendations
- Include purchase receipts for warranty tracking
- Set quantities for items you have multiples of (like white t-shirts)

## Troubleshooting

**Q: What if AI doesn't recognize my item?**  
A: No worries! You can use Manual Entry to add the item yourself, or try retaking the photo with better lighting.

**Q: How do I add multiple items quickly?**  
A: Use the Bulk Upload feature! Select multiple photos from your gallery (up to 10), and we'll process them all at once.

**Q: The app says I need credits. What does that mean?**  
A: AI scanning uses credits to process photos. Check your account settings to view your credit balance or purchase more credits.

**Q: Can I edit an item after adding it?**  
A: Yes! Tap on any item in your closet to view its details, then tap the edit button to make changes.

**Q: What if the AI gets the category or details wrong?**  
A: Simply tap on any field to edit it. The AI is quite accurate, but you have full control to correct any mistakes.

**Q: Can I add items without photos?**  
A: Yes! Use Manual Entry and simply skip adding photos. You can always add photos later by editing the item.
